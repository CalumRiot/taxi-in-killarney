## **Overview**
---
Taxi In Killarney is a site developed for a self-employed taxi driver based in Killarney, Co.Kerry, Ireland. The aim of the website is to provide information to customers about the services offered, to allow customers to make bookings online and to increase the number of customers by providing tours which would appeal to tourists looking to explore the areas surrounding Killarney. The website is 3 page website designed with a mobile-first approach. The websites 3 pages are Home, Tours and Bookings Page. The websites development is still ongoing and may be updated or changed in order to suit the needs or demands of both the page owner and it's users.
### Features
1. Navigation Bar

A navigation bar has been used to assist users with navigating the website. The Navigation Bar has a 2 system design allowing desktop devices to use a different navigation bar to that of mobile users. Mobile Devices will find there navigation bar to be a clickable "hamburger" icon making it easier to display the navigation bar to smaller screen width devices. While on desktop there is no "hamburger" icon but rather the three pages Home, Tours and Bookings are postioned in the top right and are displayed rather then hidden.

2. Interactive Gallery

The index page features an interactive gallery allowing users to click on each image resulting in the image opening in a new tab allowing the user to get a better full sized look at the image they have selected.

3. Booking Form

On the Contact page users will find a booking form allowing the user the book a journey completely online this is designed to alleviate the pressure's caused by the owners previous mobile bookings only approach. This booking form should therefore assist with creating work for the owner without the need of having to confirm each booking via mobile.

4. Tours Section

On the Tours page users can find a detailed summary describing the tours offered by the owner. These include tours to Slea Head Drive, Ring of Kerry, the Lakes of Killarney and the Cliffs of Moher. This should help encourage tour bookings from tourists looking to see the sites in and around Killarney and hopefully increase overall bookings for these tours.

5. Services Section

The services section gives a brief summary of each of the services offered by Taxi In Killarney these include a Taxi Service, Guided Tours, Airport Transfers and Golf Chaffeuring. The services section is designed to make it easy for users to see what services they can use and will hopefully encourage users to avail of these services.

6. The Footer

The footer section provides links to the relevant social media platforms for Taxi In Killarney. The links open in a new tab making it easy for the user to navigate to the social media site they have selected. The footer can be found at the bottom of each page on the website.

### Features Left to Implement

1. Animated Gallery

Ideally the Gallery found on the index page should be a fully animated gallery providing each image that is shown in a slideshow swapping between images every few seconds attempts to create this intially have failed due to the need for Javascript to be used. Therefore it is something I could look into implementing once my Javascript knowledge is up to scratch.

2. Auto Email Booking System

The booking system as shown simply takes details and sends them too a file dump. Ideally when the website is fully live I would like to have a automatic system in place which sends emails to both the user and owner whenever a booking is made. The user would recieve an email confirming there booking while the owner would recieve an email with all the booking details.

3. Additional Pages for Airport Transfers & Golf Chaffeuring

With each airport being a fixed distance from Killarney and due to the demand for Airport Transfers ideally an additional page dedicated to Airport Transfers would need to be implemented. Similar to the tours page it would list each of the four airports serviced and provide a cost per person for each one. A Golf Chaffeuring page could also be added following a similar design layout to the tours and airport transfers pages.

### Strategy

The website is designed to provide customers with up to date information about the business and what services the business can provide to them. The overall aim of this project was to design a user-friendly website that caters for both mobile and desktop devices. It can assist both new and existing customers with availing of the services provided by the owner. These design decisions were made based on research and comments from both users & the business owner.

### Scope

The main focus of the project was to help design a simplistic styled website that would be easy to navigate and provide relevant information to it's users. The main aim was to help the business owner combat the loss in revenue he has seen sense the onset of Covid-19 and to combat the losses in customers that he has seen sense 3rd party apps like FreeNow have enter the Irish market.

### Structure

The websites structure is designed to entice users. I done this by having my interactive gallery as the first thing people see when they open the website with the hope that the vivid images will make them want to scroll further. All information displayed is short and concise so as not to overload the user with too much information. Relevant contact information is displayed on the contact page should the user wish to contact the owner via email or phone. The footer provides relevant links to the owners social media pages.

### Skeleton

The website is a 3 paged website with 5 Sections

Pages:
1. Home Page
2. Tours Page
3. Contact Page

Sections:
* Gallery

### User Stories

* As the owner, I want to expand my online presence by providing a website to my customers to provide bookings as well as provide information on services that I provide.

* As the owner, I would like to reduce phone based bookings by giving my customers an alternative. I also want a digital presence to help compete against 3rd party Taxi Apps such as FreeNow.

* As a customer, It would be nice to know more about the services provided by the owner as well as be able to make bookings in advance.

* As a potential customer, I would like to explore the surrounding areas of Killarney. Having a list of potential tours and info about them would make it easier to decide.
